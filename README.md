# Team Profile Generator

This application allows the user to create a team through the command line that will then be displayed through the browser.  

The user will start the application and need to install the dependencies by entering `npm install`.  After this is complete, they can run the application with the `node app.js` command in the command line.  

The user will be prompted for the manager's information (name, id, email, office number).  They will then be asked if they want to add any more team members (they can add as many as they choose).  The options for team members are Engineer or Intern.  

If they choose engineer, they will be asked for their name, id, email and GitHub username.  If they choose an intern, they will be asked for their name, id, email and school they attend.  They can also choose to not and any more team members. 

The HTML will provide the user with a website that will display the team member's information.
